      <h3><a href="https://github.com/ShireeshPyreddy/SymptoGraph">Evaluating BiLSTM vs. CNN for Symptom-Based Disease Prediction with Knowledge Graph Integration</a></h3>
    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>
While exploring innovative ideas for my deep learning course, the concept of <b>AI in Healthcare</b> resonated deeply with me. This project reflects my passion for applying AI and NLP to the healthcare industry and combines it with my expertise in NLP and Knowledge Graphs to address impactful challenges at this intersection.</p>
    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>This study introduces SymptoGraph, a novel approach to disease prediction using symptom descriptions, focusing on a comparative analysis of BiLSTM and CNN neural network architectures. Previous efforts in this domain predominantly utilized conventional machine learning techniques. Our work extends this by integrating a knowledge graph construction, which facilitates a deeper understanding of the semantics and relationships between symptoms and diseases. The research systematically compares the predictive capabilities of BiLSTM and CNN, considering their ability to process and interpret complex symptom data. The incorporation of knowledge graphs aims to enhance the contextual understanding of diseases, potentially leading to more accurate and semantically rich disease predictions. This project not only provides insights into the relative strengths of BiLSTM and CNN in medical diagnosis but also illustrates the added value of knowledge graph integration in advancing the field of symptom-based disease prediction.</p>

      <p><b>Note:</b> As mentioned in the audio, these models are not using Knowledge Graph, it's the extension and an added layer to deep dive into the semantics and relations of diseases and symptoms.</p>

    <h3>Future Scope:</h3>
      <p>I have provided few examples in the paper but continuation of this research is:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
        <li>How can we add data from multiple sources to expand the graph?</li>
        <li>How can this graph be used and integrated into downstream applications (like using GrapRAG or providing structured information to LLMs to make them better understand)?</li>
    </ul>
    <!--    <p>Designed a disease prediction system leveraging NLP techniques, building a knowledge graph to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency in identifying disease patterns.</p>-->

    <h3>A Comparative Analysis of Positivity and Negativity in Humans’ Comments and LLM-Generated Responses</h3>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Generative AI has seen widespread use in various applications recently, generating diverse opinions about its impact. People express both positive and negative sentiments toward its use. In this study, we collect human tweets on key terms such as ChatGPT, OpenAI, Copilot, and LLMs, all of which are related to generative AI. Our goal is to explore the emotional intelligence of ChatGPT, a large language model, by comparing its responses to human comments through sentiment analysis. We propose EmoXpt, a sentiment analysis technique that not only examines human sentiment about generative AI but also analyzes ChatGPT's sentiment. While existing research has focused on human sentiment regarding generative AI, EmoXpt is the first technique to assess ChatGPT's sentiment on the subject. Our experimental results show that LLM-generated responses are more efficient, cohesive, and positive compared to human responses.</p>
